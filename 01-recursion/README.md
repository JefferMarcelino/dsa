# Recursion Exercises

This directory contains Python implementations of common recursion exercises. Each script demonstrates a fundamental recursive approach to solving problems.

## Understanding Recursion

Recursion is a method where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of a problem. Each recursive function must have:
- A **base case** to stop recursion.
- A **recursive step** that reduces the problem size.
